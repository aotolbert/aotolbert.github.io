            Throughout this class. We have been tasked with the design and coding of a couple of unique and challenging programs all designed to exhibit some level of aptitude in certian areas of programming in Javascript. I learned throughout this process that I much prefer working on the back-end to the front-end and that may come out in the "unimaginative" look ot some of my programs but in a bootcamp, get it done quick and if you have time make it look nice. Here are just a few examples of sites that I have worked on.

            For our first group project, we were cursed with the open ended instructions of "make something cool" and let loose for a week. In that week, two of my fellow cohorts and I grueled over a number of API's, CSS tricks, java script woes, Google Maps registrations, and many more issues that the more seasoned develpoers amoung you are well aware of. While it was a long process I am happy to say that I am quite happy with what we created which is a widgit that allows the user to look up state representatives and senators as well as federal senators based only on an address. It utililzes 3 seperate APIs, CORS filters, and a few other cools things that you can see for youself!

            Who doesn't love a good Gif?? (It's pronounced Gif as in "gift" not Jif as in the Peanut Butter...) This application is a fully functional gif generator that come preloaded with some of my favorite animal gifs but through the Gify API, you are able to look up gifs of anything you'd like! The site features java script elements such as dynamic browser addition amd subtraction, local storage, and API calls. Feel free to try it out yourself and see what fun gifs you can find out there!

            Towards the beginning of our class, we were still working with timers and user inputs and validation so I made a trivia game based on The Barclays Premier Leauge. Its features timers, lists, and a win loss counter based on the number of correct guesses. As a big premier leauge fan this was by far one of my favorite projects to work on especially as I got to find some funny/impressive images/gifs of the players that show based on the guess of the user. Feel free to test your knowledge of the famous football leauge from across the pond!

        This is one of the first projects I ever programmed and that is quite apparent in more ways than one. In addition to being one of the clunkiest looking sites I've ever made/seen, it also isn't a very fun game. But the code behind it was challenging enough for a beginner like I was at the time and at the time, I learned a lot from this silly game. It features random number generators, dynamic document object, and a few if else statements to keep track of the wins, losses, teams, etc. and while there is almost no thought given to improving the UX, the basic functionality is there.
